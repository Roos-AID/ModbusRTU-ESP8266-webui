# Modbus-Janitza firmware



The features of this Modbus-Janitza firmware are:
- Implementing the Modbus RTU protocol on the NodeMCU (8266)
- Initially designed to read Jantitza UMG96RM energy monitor registers and display in webUI
- enable telnet listening (for debugging and some commands)
- a REST API (http://<ip>/api/v1/Modbus/Modbusmonitor
- settings for Hostname, MQTT and NTP in the webUI 
- settings for Modbus baudrate, RTU slave address in the webUI
- Registers and formats to be read can be configured in config file Modbusmap.cfg 
- Register values can be converted by a set factor in the config file for display in Webui (eg. read Wh and display kWh)
- Time/day based GPIO setting to enable external relay to allow for day/night energy monitoring/use
- Telnet commands are s = switch relay (to test function), t = list Daytime map , r = re-read Daytimemap.cfg

To do:
- Rename the utility to show that it can be used genericly for Modbus RTU register reading
- InfluxDB client to do direct logging
- Update of specific registers through MQTT (low prio)
